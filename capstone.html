            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <div>
                The Purpose of the “How to Train Your Dragon Boat” Application is to provide the George Brown College Dragon Boat Team with an application that is intended to aid the team with the common tasks performed for the team. The team’s most important tasks, which include the management of team members, the creation of dragon boat layouts, and the monitoring of dragon boat teams during practice are currently done through manual methods, mainly through scrap paper, and as a result are of very low effectiveness and efficiency. The How to Train Your Dragon Boat application will tackle these specific problems, in order to provide a much higher level of efficiency during the completion of the Dragon Boat team’s tasks.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <div>
                The problem of coordinating optimized dragon boat member placement by manual methods affects the individuals involved with dragon boat activities, either as a team member or a team leader. The impact of which is a time consuming and inefficient method of dragon boat seating assignment, followed by a lack of information regarding the performance of the dragon boat team. A successful solution would be a software application offering algorithms that will allow for the process of dragon boat member placement to be achieved with great efficiency, in addition to provide a variety of tools and data that will allow for crucial information about the dragon boat team’s performance to be recorded with ease.
