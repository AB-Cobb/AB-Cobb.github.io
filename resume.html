                <h3>To Hiring Managers</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I’m looking for a position where I can advance my interests in Robotics, Automation, Mobile, IoT and to build cool things. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I have a long-standing interest in these fields: building autonomous Sumo robots with the Western Canadian Robotics Society, building an ROV to compete in the Marine Advanced Technology competition, my final year project for Mobile Development involves building a WiFi robot, controlled by an iPhone, via an AWS cloud server, using the RESTful API. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This has given me valuable experience in team collaboration to deploy working projects under tight deadlines.  I am excited by the idea of leveraging this experience to develop real-world solutions
                </p><br>
                <p>   
                    My resume will demonstrate that I have the relevant technical skills in .NET, OO design, C++, C#, JAVA, REACT, and Databases and I’m keen to put them to use!  A shopping list of technologies is all very well, but the important thing is my ability to quickly learn new technologies and work out how to put them to practical use.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I believe I would be an excellent fit at your company and look forward to meeting you soon to explore opportunities further.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Regards,</p>
